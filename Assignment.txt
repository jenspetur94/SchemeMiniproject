 groups
	- constructor function for single group
	- group predicate function
	- selector function that returns list of stugsldents in a group
	- selector function that returns group id

 grouping
	- group from grouping
	- number of groups in grouping
	- maximum group size
 	- minimum group size

the grouping functions will serve as grouping constructor functions
	-write a predicate that identifies a grouping object.


write pretty printing functions for students, groups and groupings


Random group:
given list of students sl and list of desired group sizes gsl , program function that form groups of lengths prescribed in gsl. 
	- should assert that  gsl list g1 + g2 .. + gk = length sl.
	- should start by making g1 in gsl 
	- should be random
	- should use recursion

Groupings by counting:
should use counting to create k groups. marks every student with the counting and creates a grouping object out of it.

Balanced grouping by counting:
a variant of grouping by counting that that should create k groups from n students and ensure equal distribution of sex and ethnicality.

sort by age and enticity

Random grouping with group predicate:
like random group it should create random groups and check if they all fullfill a given predicate. If they don't it should be redone. up to a 1000 times
funktionen er en funktion hved siden af der checker om en given gruppe opfylder et given predicate. lav gruppe, check funktion
